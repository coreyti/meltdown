# Meltdown

meltdown... An alternative to [pow](http://pow.cx/) and
[powder](http://git.io/powder)

meltdown... A result of my frustrations with the above.  Handles local DNS,
like *pow*, but assumes that (read "allows for") you to set up your own
http --> app server configuration (e.g., with nginx).

At some future point, *meltdown* may include http proxy-ing capabilities,
like *pow*, but it's just DNS for now.

## Installation
